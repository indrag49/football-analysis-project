# football-analysis-project
This is a repository introducing hands-on football (soccer) data analyses, targeting those who want to start working with their own football data and perform analyses.

This project introduces the following concepts:
1. How to access open event data from [*statsbomb* api](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data#:~:text=StatsBomb%20Open%20Data%20Welcome%20to%20the%20StatsBomb%20Open,encourage%20new%20research%20and%20analysis%20at%20all%20levels.),
2. How to draw and visualize a soccer pitch using [*mplsoccer*](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), 
3. How to visualize a pass network for a particular team in a particular map,
4. How to use [*NetworkX*](https://networkx.org/) module to analyse the pass network (eg. finding out degree distribution of passes, clustering coefficient, centrality, etc.), and finally
5. How to implement computational geometric concepts like Convex Hulls, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to understand and visualize football traking data (using [*scipy.spatial*](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html) and *mplsoccer*).
