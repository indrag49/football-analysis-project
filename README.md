# An Introduction to Football (Soccer) Data Analysis with Python
This is a repository introducing hands-on football (soccer) data analyses to those who want to start working with football data and perform analyses on the same.

# Summary:

---
This project introduces the following concepts:
1. How to access open event data from [*statsbomb* api](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data#:~:text=StatsBomb%20Open%20Data%20Welcome%20to%20the%20StatsBomb%20Open,encourage%20new%20research%20and%20analysis%20at%20all%20levels.) {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Introductory%20football%20analysis.ipynb)},
2. How to draw and visualize a soccer pitch using [*mplsoccer*](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Introductory%20football%20analysis.ipynb)}, 
3. How to visualize a pass network map for a particular team in a particular game {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Introductory%20football%20analysis.ipynb)},
4. How to use [*NetworkX*](https://networkx.org/) module to analyse the pass network (eg. finding out degree distribution of passes, clustering coefficient, centrality, etc.) {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Introductory%20football%20analysis.ipynb)}, 
5. How to implement computational geometric concepts like Convex Hulls, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to understand and visualize football tracking data (using [*scipy.spatial*](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html) and *mplsoccer*) {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Voronoi%20diagrams%20and%20Delaunay%20triangulations%20on%20football%20data.ipynb)},
6. How to analyse *Expected Goals (xG)* using open data from *statsbomb* {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/xG%20analysis.ipynb)},
7. How to use *Linear Regression* on football data, with the help of [*scikit learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) module, to predict correlation betweeen *Goals scored* and *Shots on goals* {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20model%20on%20football%20data.ipynb)},
8. How to use * Logistic Regression* to predict whether a pass is a successful pass or not (given some features of the pass) {[Notebook](https://github.com/indrag49/football-analysis-project/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20to%20predict%20the%20pass%20outcome%20in%20a%20match.ipynb)}.
