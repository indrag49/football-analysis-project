# An Introduction to Football (Soccer) Data Analysis with Python
This is a repository introducing hands-on football (soccer) data analyses to those who want to start working with football data and perform analyses on the same.

# Summary:

---
This project introduces the following concepts:
1. How to access open event data from [*statsbomb* api](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data#:~:text=StatsBomb%20Open%20Data%20Welcome%20to%20the%20StatsBomb%20Open,encourage%20new%20research%20and%20analysis%20at%20all%20levels.),
2. How to draw and visualize a soccer pitch using [*mplsoccer*](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), 
3. How to visualize a pass network map for a particular team in a particular game,
4. How to use [*NetworkX*](https://networkx.org/) module to analyse the pass network (eg. finding out degree distribution of passes, clustering coefficient, centrality, etc.), 
5. How to implement computational geometric concepts like Convex Hulls, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to understand and visualize football tracking data (using [*scipy.spatial*](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html) and *mplsoccer*),
6. How to analyse *Expected Goals (xG)* using open data from *statsbomb*,
7. How to use *Linear Regression Model* on football data, with the help of [*scikit learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) module
